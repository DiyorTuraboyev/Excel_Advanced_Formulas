# Excel_Advanced_Formulas
In this repository I store Excel files and projects that done with Advanced Excel Formulas. 
List of Advanced formulas Excel:
INDEX – Retrieve cell in nth position in a range
MATCH – Find position of value in a range
INDEX MATCH – Just like VLOOKUP, only better.
SUMPRODUCT – Sum the products of Excel ranges
Excel Wildcards – Advanced searching and matching in Excel
Advanced Filter – Filter by multiple criteria in the same column, or even in different columns!
