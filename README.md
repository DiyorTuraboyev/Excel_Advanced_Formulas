In this repository I store Excel files and projects that done with Advanced Excel Formulas. <br/>
List of Advanced formulas Excel:<br/>
INDEX – Retrieve cell in nth position in a range<br/>
MATCH – Find position of value in a range<br/>
INDEX MATCH – Just like VLOOKUP, only better.<br/>
SUMPRODUCT – Sum the products of Excel ranges<br/>
Excel Wildcards – Advanced searching and matching in Excel<br/>
Advanced Filter – Filter by multiple criteria in the same column, or even in different columns!<br/>
